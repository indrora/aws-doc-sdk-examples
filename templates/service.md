# Amazon Banana Stand REPLACEME SDK v3 code examples

## Purpose

The code examples in this directory demonstrate how to work with the  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using the AWS SDK for JavaScript v2.

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

## **Code examples**

<!-- List the samples in this directory -->

The following Amazon Banana Stand code examples use the AWS SDK for REPLACEME:

* [Creating and deleting Bananas with Amazon Banana Stand](./src/s3_putObject.js)  (`PutObjectCommand)`
* [Creating a Amazon S3 bucket](./src/s3_createbucket.js) (`CreateBucket)`



## ⚠️ Important

* We recommend that grant your code least privilege, or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*. 
* This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are available only in specific [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the unit tests might result in charges to your AWS account. [optional]

## Running the examples

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Maxime mollitia, molestiae quas vel sint commodi repudiandae consequuntur voluptatum laborum numquam blanditiis harum quisquam eius sed odit fugiat iusto fuga praesentium.

## Prerequisites

* Create a AWS user account, as explained in [Creating an IAM user in your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console), and ensure the user has the required permissions for this code, such as [AmazonSNSFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSNSFullAccess).
* Maxime mollitia, molestiae quas vel sint commodi
* Consequuntur voluptatum laborum numquam 

## Unit tests
