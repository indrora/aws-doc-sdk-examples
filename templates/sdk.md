# AWS SDK for REPLACEME documentation examples

This workspace contains both single service and cross-service examples for the [AWS SDK for REPLACEME.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/REPLACESLUG/latest/developer-guide/)

The AWS SDK for REPLACEME provides a REPLACEME API for AWS infrastructure services. Using the SDK, you can build application on top of Amazon S3, Amazon EC3, Amazon DynamoDB, and more.

## AWS single-service examples

The AWS single-service REPLACEME examples demonstrate how to perform single-action API calls. 

They are divided by AWS service into their respective folders. Within each folder there is a pom.xml file used for building the examples with Maven, and a Makefile that wraps the Maven commands for those of you who also have make installed.

## AWS cross-service examples

The AWS cross-service examples demonstrate how to combine multiple AWS.  By following these examples, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to create REPLACEME-based applications that use the AWS SDK for REPLACEME V2. 

They are divided by example into the folders located in the [cross-services folder](./example_code/). Within each cross-service example folder there is a README that describes how to run the example.

## Prerequisites for AWS SDK for REPLACEME examples
